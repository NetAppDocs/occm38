Add a Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL system license to add additional capacity, update an existing system license, and manage BYOL licenses for Backup to Cloud.

== Managing system licenses

You can purchase multiple licenses for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL system to allocate more than 368 TB of capacity. For example, you might purchase two licenses to allocate up to 736 TB of capacity to Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Or you could purchase four licenses to get up to 1.4 PB.

The number of licenses that you can purchase for a single node system or HA pair is unlimited.

=== Obtaining a system license file

In most cases, Cloud Manager can automatically obtain your license file using your NetApp Support Site account. But if it can't, then you'll need to manually upload the license file. If you don't have the license file, you can obtain it from netapp.com.

.Steps

. Go to the https://register.netapp.com/register/getlicensefile[NetApp License File Generator^] and log in using your NetApp Support Site credentials.

. Enter your password, choose your product, enter the serial number, confirm that you have read and accepted the privacy policy, and then click *Submit*.

=== Adding a new system license

Add a new BYOL system license at any time to allocate an additional 368 TB of capacity to your Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL system.

.Steps

=== Updating a system license

When you renew a BYOL subscription by contacting a NetApp representative, Cloud Manager automatically obtains the new license from NetApp and installs it on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

If Cloud Manager can't access the license file over the secure internet connection, you can obtain the file yourself and then manually upload the file to Cloud Manager.

.Steps

. In Cloud Manager, open the Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL working environment.

. Click the menu icon and then click *License*.

. Click *Update CVO System License*.
