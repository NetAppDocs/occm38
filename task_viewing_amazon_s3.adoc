After you install a Connector in AWS, Cloud Manager can automatically discover information about the Amazon S3 buckets that reside in the AWS account where it's installed.

You can see details about your S3 buckets, including the region, access level, storage class, and whether the bucket is used with Cloud Volumes ONTAP for backups or data tiering. And you can scan the S3 buckets with Cloud Compliance.
