summary: You use a Google Cloud account to deploy Cloud Manager in a project. You can then deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in the same project or a different project. Google Cloud accounts that you add to Cloud Manager are used to enable data tiering.

A service account provides Cloud Manager with permissions to deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in the same project as Cloud Manager, or in different projects.

== Project and permissions for Cloud Manager

Before you can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Google Cloud, you must first deploy a Connector in a Google Cloud project. The Connector can't be running on your premises, or in a different cloud provider.

Two sets of permissions must be in place before you deploy a Connector directly from Cloud Manager:

. You need to deploy a Connector using a Google account that has permissions to launch the Connector VM instance from Cloud Manager.

. When deploying the Connector, you are prompted to select a https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts[service account^] for the VM instance. Cloud Manager gets permissions from the service account to create and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems on your behalf. Permissions are provided by attaching a custom role to the service account.

We have set up two YAML files that include the required permissions for the user and the service account. link:task_creating_connectors_gcp.html[Learn how to use the YAML files to set up permissions].

The following image depicts the permission requirements described in numbers 1 and 2 above:

== Project for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Cloud Volumes ONTAP can reside in the same project as the Connector, or in a different project. To deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a different project, you need to first add the Connector service account and role to that project.

== Account for data tiering

TIP: Cloud Manager requires a GCP account for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6, but not for 9.7 and later. If you want to use data tiering with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7, then follow step 4 in link:task_getting_started_gcp.html[Getting started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Google Cloud Platform].

Adding a Google Cloud account to Cloud Manager is required to enable data tiering on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6 system. Data tiering automatically tiers cold data to low-cost object storage, enabling you to reclaim space on your primary storage and shrink secondary storage.

When you add the account, you need to provide Cloud Manager with a storage access key for a service account that has Storage Admin permissions. Cloud Manager uses the access keys to set up and manage a Cloud Storage bucket for data tiering.

After you add a Google Cloud account, you can then enable data tiering on individual volumes when you create, modify, or replicate them.
