You will want to train your users on the best practices for accessing the shared files through Global File Cache.

This is the final phase of the Global File Cache deployment, the end-user implementation phase.

In order to prepare and streamline the end user on-boarding process, use the email template below that will help you to educate end users on what it means to work in a "central data" environment. This will help your users leverage all of the benefits of the Global File Cache solution. We have also published a video that can be shared to "train" users where needed.

Customize and forward the following resources to end users to prepare them for roll-out:

* User Training video
