Complete a few steps to get started backing up data from your on-premises ONTAP system to low-cost object storage in the cloud.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Verify support for your configuration

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* You have discovered the on-premises cluster and added it to a working environment in Cloud Manager. See link:task_discovering_ontap.html[Discovering ONTAP clusters^] for details.
* You're running ONTAP 9.7P5 or later on the cluster.
* You have a valid cloud provider subscription for the storage space where your backups will be located.
* You have subscribed to the https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.cloud-manager?tab=Overview[Cloud Manager Marketplace Backup offering^], or you have purchased link:task_managing_licenses.html#adding-and-updating-your-backup-byol-license[and activated^] a Backup to Cloud BYOL license from NetApp.

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Select the cloud provider and enter provider details

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the provider and then select the provider subscription, the region, and resource group. You also need to specify the IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the volumes reside.

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Define the backup policy

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The default policy backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies of each volume. Change to weekly or monthly backups, or select one of the system-defined policies that provide more options.

==== image:number5.png[Number 5] Select the volumes that you want to back up

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Identify which volumes you want to back up from the cluster.

==== image:number6.png[Number 6] Restore your data, as needed

[role="quick-margin-para"]
From the Backup List, select a volume, select a backup, and then restore data from the backup to a new volume on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that is using the same cloud provider.

== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure you have a supported configuration before you start backing up volumes to Azure Blob storage.

Supported ONTAP versions::
ONTAP 9.7P5 and later.

Cluster networking requirements::

An intercluster LIF is required on each ONTAP node that hosts the volumes you want to back up. The LIF must be associated with the _IPspace_ that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage. The Admin SVM must reside on the IPspace. http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-nmg/GUID-69120CF0-F188-434F-913E-33ACB8751A5D.html[Learn more about IPspaces^].
+
When you set up backup to cloud, you are prompted for the IPspace to use. You should choose the IPspace that each LIF is associated with. That might be the "Default" IPspace or a custom IPspace that you created.

Supported Azure regions::
Backup to Cloud is supported in all Azure regions https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[where cloud volumes are supported^].

License requirements::
For Backup to Cloud PAYGO licensing, a subscription to the https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.cloud-manager?tab=Overview[Azure Marketplace Cloud Manager Backup offering^] is required before you enable Backup to Cloud. Billing for Backup to Cloud is done through this subscription.
+
For Backup to Cloud BYOL licensing, you need the serial number from NetApp that enables you to use the service for the duration and capacity of the license. See link:task_managing_licenses.html#adding-and-updating-your-backup-byol-license[Adding and updating your Backup BYOL license^].
+
And you need to have a Microsoft Azure subscription for the storage space where your backups will be located.

== Enabling Backup to Cloud

Enable Backup to Cloud at any time directly from the working environment.

.Steps

. Select the working environment and click *Activate* next to the Backup to Cloud service in the right-panel.
+
image:screenshot_backup_to_s3_icon.gif[A screenshot that shows the Backup to Cloud Activate button which is available after you select a working environment.]

. Select the provider, and then enter the provider details:
.. The Azure subscription used to store the backups.
.. The Azure region.
.. The resource group - you can create a new resource group or select and existing resource group.
.. The IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the volumes you want to back up reside.
.. And then click *Continue*.
+

+
Note that you cannot change the subscription or the resource group after the services has started.

. In the _Define Policy_ page, select the backup schedule and retention value and click *Continue*.
+
