Pay for Cloud Tiering through a pay-as-you-go subscription, an ONTAP tiering license called _FabricPool_, or a combination of both. If you want to pay as you go, then you need to subscribe from the marketplace for the cloud provider to which you want to tier cold data. There's no need to subscribe from every marketplace.

A few notes before you read any further:

* If a FabricPool license is already installed on your cluster, then you’re all set—there's nothing else that you need to do.

* If you've already subscribed to the Cloud Manager subscription in your cloud provider's marketplace, then you're automatically subscribed to Cloud Tiering, as well. You'll see an active subscription in the Cloud Tiering *Licensing* tab. You won't need to subscribe again.

* There are no charges when tiering data to StorageGRID. Neither a BYOL license or PAYGO registration is required.

== Adding a tiering license to ONTAP

Bring your own license by purchasing an ONTAP FabricPool license from NetApp.

.Steps

. If you don't have a FabricPool license, mailto:ng-cloud-tiering@netapp.com?subject=Licensing[contact us to purchase one].

. In Cloud Manager, click *Tiering > Licensing*.

. In the Clusters List table, click *Activate license (BYOL)* for an on-prem ONTAP cluster.

. Enter the serial number of the license and then enter the NetApp Support Site account that's associated with the serial number.

. Click *Activate license*.

.Result

Cloud Tiering registers the license and installs it on the cluster.

.After you finish

If you purchase additional add-on capacity at a later time, the license on the cluster is automatically updated with the new capacity. There's no need to apply a new NetApp License File (NLF) to the cluster.
