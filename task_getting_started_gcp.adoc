Get started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP for GCP in a few steps.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Create a Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you don't have a link:concept_connectors.html[Connector] yet, an Account Admin needs to create one. link:task_creating_connectors_gcp.html[Learn how to create a Connector in GCP].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When you create your first Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment, Cloud Manager prompts you to deploy a Connector if you don't have one yet.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Plan your configuration

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Cloud Manager offers preconfigured packages that match your workload requirements, or you can create your own configuration. If you choose your own configuration, you should understand the options available to you. link:task_planning_your_config_gcp.html[Learn more].

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Set up your networking

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. Ensure that your VPC and subnets will support connectivity between the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.. Enable outbound internet access from the target VPC so the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP can contact several endpoints.
+
This step is important because the Connector can't manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP without outbound internet access. If you need to limit outbound connectivity, refer to the list of endpoints for link:reference_networking_gcp.html[the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Set up GCP for data tiering

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Two requirements must be met to tier cold data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to low-cost object storage (a Google Cloud Storage bucket):

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access[Configure the Cloud Volumes ONTAP subnet for Private Google Access^].

.. https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[Set up a service account for data tiering^]:
+
* Assign the predefined _Storage Admin_ role to the tiering service account.
* Add the Connector service account as a _Service Account User_ to the tiering service account.
+
You can provide the user role https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[in step 3 of the wizard when you create the tiering service account], or https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_user_for_a_service_account[grant the role after the service account was created^].
+
You'll need to select the tiering service account later when you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.
+
If you don't enable data tiering and select a service account when you create the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, then you'll need to turn off the system and add the service account to Cloud Volumes ONTAP from the GCP console.

==== image:number5.png[Number 5] Enable Google Cloud APIs

[role="quick-margin-para"]
https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis[Enable the following Google Cloud APIs in your project^]. These APIs are required to deploy the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* Cloud Deployment Manager V2 API
* Cloud Logging API
* Cloud Resource Manager API
* Compute Engine API
* Identity and Access Management (IAM) API

==== image:number6.png[Number 6] Launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP using Cloud Manager

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Click *Add Working Environment*, select the type of system that you would like to deploy, and complete the steps in the wizard. link:task_deploying_gcp.html[Read step-by-step instructions].
