.Result

Cloud Analyzer starts processing your AWS account data. If you have multiple accounts, Cloud Analyzer starts with read-only capabilities for all linked accounts under the master payer account. If you want to get more details about the potential savings for those accounts, then you'll need to connect them, as well. You can find more details about that process in the section below.

== Analyze your compute costs

After Cloud Analyzer processes your account data, the Compute tab shows you insights on past, current, and future cloud costs.

Month to date cost:: The total cost of your workloads from the beginning of the current month to present.

Projected Costs:: The forecasted cost at the end of the month based on analysis of your usage pattern.

Last Week Missed Savings:: Savings that could have been achieved in the previous seven days using optimization of spot instances and reservations.

Top AWS Account Spend Efficiency:: The top 10 accounts according to the greatest amount of estimated additional savings.
+
Each account is assigned an efficiency score based on current and additional potential savings. The estimated additional savings indicates how much can be further saved by leveraging the use of spot and reserved instances.
+
You can take the following actions to further optimize your accounts:
+
* *View details*: View your cost optimization opportunities by going to Spot's Cloud Analyzer.
* *Connect*: Connect an account that is not yet managed. You will be directed to the wizard that connects the account.

Top AWS Accounts:: This is a bar graph showing your top ten accounts by cost. The graph is based on the last 30 days of spend activity.
