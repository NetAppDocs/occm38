Cloud Sync can copy access control lists (ACLs) between a source SMB share and a target SMB share. If needed, you can manually preserve the ACLs yourself by using robocopy.

.Choices

* <<Setting up Cloud Sync to copy ACLs between SMB servers,Set up Cloud Sync to automatically copy ACLs>>
* <<Manually copying ACLs,Manually copy the ACLs yourself>>

== Setting up Cloud Sync to copy ACLs between SMB servers

Copy ACLs between SMB servers by enabling a setting when you create a relationship or after you create a relationship.

Note that this feature is available for new sync relationships created after the 23 Feb 2020 release. If you’d like to use this feature with existing relationships created prior to that date, then you’ll need to recreate the relationship.

.What you'll need

* A new sync relationship or an existing sync relationship created after the 23 Feb 2020 release.

* Any type of data broker.
+
This feature works with _any_ type of data broker: the AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or on-prem data broker. The on-prem data broker can run link:task_sync_installing_linux.html[any supported operating system].

.Steps for a new relationship

. From Cloud Sync, click *Create New Sync*.

. Drag and drop *SMB Server* to the source and target and click *Continue*.

. On the *SMB Server* page:
.. Enter a new SMB server or select an existing server and click *Continue*.
.. Enter credentials for the SMB server.
.. Select *Copy Access Control Lists to the target* and click *Continue*.

. Follow the remaining prompts to create the sync relationship.

.Steps for an existing relationship

. Hover over the sync relationship and click the action menu.

. Click *Settings*.

. Select *Copy Access Control Lists to the target*.

. Click *Save Settings*.

.Result

When syncing data, Cloud Sync preserves the ACLs between the source and target SMB shares.

== Manually copying ACLs

You can manually preserve ACLs between SMB shares by using the Windows robocopy command.

.Steps

. Identify a Windows host that has full access to both SMB shares.

. If either of the endpoints require authentication, use the *net use* command to connect to the endpoints from the Windows host.
+
You must perform this step before you use robocopy.

. From Cloud Sync, create a new relationship between the source and target SMB shares or sync an existing relationship.

. After the data sync is complete, run the following command from the Windows host to sync the ACLs and ownership:
+
 robocopy /E /COPY:SOU /secfix [source] [target] /w:0 /r:0 /XD ~snapshots /UNILOG:”[logfilepath]
+
Both _source_ and _target_ should be specified using the UNC format. For example: \\<server>\<share>\<path>
