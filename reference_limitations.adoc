Known limitations identify platforms, devices, or functions that are not supported by this release of the product, or that do not interoperate correctly with it. Review these limitations carefully.

== Connectors should remain running

A Connector should remain running at all times. It's important for the continued health and operation of the services that you enable.

For example, a Connector is a key component in the health and operation of Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO systems. If a Connector is powered down, Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO systems will shut down after losing communication with a Connector for longer than 14 days.

== SaaS platform is disabled for Government regions

If you deploy a Connector in an AWS GovCloud region, an Azure Gov region, or an Azure DoD region, access to Cloud Manager is available only through a Connector's host IP address. Access to the SaaS platform is disabled for the entire account.

This means that only privileged users who can access the end-user internal VPC/VNet can use Cloud Manager's UI or API.

It also means that the following services aren't available from Cloud Manager:

* Cloud Compliance
* Kubernetes
* Cloud Tiering
* Global File Cache
* Monitoring (Cloud Insights)

The SaaS platform is required to use these services.

== Shared Linux hosts are not supported

The Connector isn't supported on a host that is shared with other applications. The host must be a dedicated host.

== Cloud Manager does not support FlexGroup volumes

While Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports FlexGroup volumes, Cloud Manager does not. If you create a FlexGroup volume from System Manager or from the CLI, then you should set Cloud Manager's Capacity Management mode to Manual. Automatic mode might not work properly with FlexGroup volumes.
