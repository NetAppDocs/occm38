Set up your Google Cloud Platform networking so Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems can operate properly. This includes networking for the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Requirements for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

The following requirements must be met in GCP.

Virtual Private Cloud::
Cloud Volumes ONTAP and the Connector are supported in a Google Cloud shared VPC and also in non-shared VPCs.
+
A shared VPC enables you to configure and centrally manage virtual networks across multiple projects. You can set up shared VPC networks in the _host project_ and deploy the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP virtual machine instances in a _service project_. https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc[Google Cloud documentation: Shared VPC overview^].
+
The only requirement when using a shared VPC is to provide the https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam#compute.networkUser[Compute Network User role^] to the Connector service account. Cloud Manager needs these permissions to query the firewalls, VPC, and subnets in the host project.

Outbound internet access for Cloud Volumes ONTAP::
Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires outbound internet access to send messages to NetApp AutoSupport, which proactively monitors the health of your storage.
+
Routing and firewall policies must allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the following endpoints so Cloud Volumes ONTAP can send AutoSupport messages:
+
* \https://support.netapp.com/aods/asupmessage
* \https://support.netapp.com/asupprod/post/1.0/postAsup
+
link:task_setting_up_ontap_cloud.html[Learn how to configure AutoSupport].

Number of IP addresses::
Cloud Manager allocates 5 IP addresses to Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP.
+
Note that Cloud Manager doesn't create an SVM management LIF for Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP.
+
TIP: A LIF is an IP address associated with a physical port. An SVM management LIF is required for management tools like SnapCenter.

Firewall rules::
You don't need to create firewall rules because Cloud Manager does that for you. If you need to use your own, refer to the firewall rules listed below.

Connection from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Google Cloud Storage for data tiering::
If you want to tier cold data to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, the subnet in which Cloud Volumes ONTAP resides must be configured for Private Google Access. For instructions, refer to https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access[Google Cloud documentation: Configuring Private Google Access^].
+
For additional steps required to set up data tiering in Cloud Manager, see link:task_tiering.html[Tiering cold data to low-cost object storage].

Connections to ONTAP systems in other networks::
To replicate data between a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in GCP and ONTAP systems in other networks, you must have a VPN connection between the VPC and the other networkâ€”for example, your corporate network.
+
For instructions, refer to https://cloud.google.com/vpn/docs/concepts/overview[Google Cloud documentation: Cloud VPN overview^].

== Requirements for the Connector

Set up your networking so that the Connector can manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. The most important step is ensuring outbound internet access to various endpoints.

TIP: If your network uses a proxy server for all communication to the internet, you can specify the proxy server from the Settings page. Refer to link:task_configuring_proxy.html[Configuring the Connector to use a proxy server].

=== Connection to target networks

A Connector requires a network connection to the VPCs and VNets in which you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

For example, if you install a Connector in your corporate network, then you must set up a VPN connection to the VPC or VNet in which you launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

=== Outbound internet access

The Connector requires outbound internet access to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. A Connector contacts the following endpoints when managing resources in GCP:

[cols="43,57",options="header"]
|===

| Purpose
|
\https://www.googleapis.com

a| Various third-party locations, for example:

* \https://repo1.maven.org/maven2
* \https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories
* \https://repo.typesafe.org

Third-party locations are subject to change.

| During upgrades, Cloud Manager downloads the latest packages for third-party dependencies.

While you should perform almost all tasks from the SaaS user interface, a local user interface is still available on the Connector. The machine running the web browser must have connections to the following endpoints:

[cols="43,57",options="header"]
|===
| Endpoints
| Purpose
|
The Connector host

a| You must enter the host's IP address from a web browser to load the Cloud Manager console.

Depending on your connectivity to your cloud provider, you can use the private IP or a public IP assigned to the host:

- A private IP works if you have a VPN and direct connect access to your virtual network
- A public IP works in any networking scenario

In any case, you should secure network access by ensuring that security group rules allow access from only authorized IPs or subnets.

|
\https://auth0.com
\https://cdn.auth0.com
\https://netapp-cloud-account.auth0.com
\https://services.cloud.netapp.com

| Your web browser connects to these endpoints for centralized user authentication through NetApp Cloud Central.

== Firewall rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Cloud Manager creates GCP firewall rules that include the inbound and outbound rules that Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP need to operate successfully. You might want to refer to the ports for testing purposes or if you prefer your to use own security groups.

The firewall rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires both inbound and outbound rules.

=== Inbound rules

The source for inbound rules in the predefined security group is 0.0.0.0/0.
