By default, Cloud Manager uses a self-signed certificate for HTTPS access to the web console. You can install a certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA), which provides better security protection than a self-signed certificate.

== Before you get started

You need to create a Connector before you can change Cloud Manager settings. link:concept_connectors.html#how-to-create-a-connector[Learn how].

== Installing an HTTPS certificate

Install a certificate signed by a CA for secure access.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the Cloud Manager console, click the Settings icon, and select *HTTPS Setup*.

+
Details about the Cloud Manager certificate displays, including the expiration date.

. Click *Renew HTTPS Certificate* and follow the steps to generate a CSR or install your own CA-signed certificate.

.Result

Cloud Manager uses the new CA-signed certificate to provide secure HTTPS access.
