An Account Admin needs to deploy a _Connector_ before you can use most Cloud Manager features. The Connector enables Cloud Manager to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. This page describes how to create a Connector directly from Cloud Manager.

These steps must be completed by a user who has the Account Admin role. A Workspace Admin can't create a Connector.

TIP: When you create your first Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment, Cloud Manager will prompt you to create a Connector if you don't have one yet.

== Creating a Connector in AWS

Cloud Manager enables you to create a Connector in AWS directly from its user interface. You also have the option to link:task_launching_aws_mktp.html[create the Connector from the AWS Marketplace], or link:task_installing_linux.html[download the software and install it on your own host].

.What you'll need

* An AWS access key and secret key for an IAM user who has the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[required permissions^].

* A VPC, subnet, and keypair in your AWS region of choice.

.Steps

. If you're creating you first Working Environment, click *Add Working Environment* and follow the prompts. Otherwise, click the Connector icon and select *Add Connector*.
+

. Click *Let's Start*.

. Choose *Amazon Web Services* as your cloud provider.
+
Remember that the Connector must have a network connection to the type of working environment that you're creating and the services that you're planning to enable.

link:reference_networking_cloud_manager.html[Learn more about networking requirements for the Connector].

. Review what you'll need and click *Continue*.

. Provide the required information:

* *AWS Credentials*: Enter a name for the instance and specify the AWS access key and secret key that meet permissions requirements.

* *Location*: Specify an AWS region, VPC, and subnet for the instance.

* *Network*: Select the key pair to use with the instance, whether to enable a public IP address, and optionally specify a proxy configuration.

* *Security Group*: Choose whether to create a new security group or whether to select an existing security group that allows inbound HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH access.

NOTE: There's no incoming traffic to the Connector, unless you initiate it. HTTP and HTTPS provide access to the link:concept_connectors.html#the-local-user-interface[local UI], which you'll use in rare circumstances. SSH is only needed if you need to connect to the host for troubleshooting.

. Click *Create*.
+
The instance should be ready in about 7 minutes. You should stay on the page until the process is complete.
