While Google Cloud Storage always encrypts your data before it’s written to disk, you can use Cloud Manager APIs to create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that uses _customer-managed encryption keys_. These are keys that you generate and manage in GCP using the Cloud Key Management Service.

.Steps

. Give the Connector service account permission to use the encryption key.

. Obtain the "id" of the key by invoking the get command for the /gcp/vsa/metadata/gcp-encryption-keys API.

. Use the "GcpEncryption" parameter with your API request when creating a working environment.

*Example*

[source,json]
"gcpEncryptionParameters": {
    "key": "projects/tlv-support/locations/us-east4/keyRings/Nikiskeys/cryptoKeys/generatedkey1"
  }

Refer to the link:api.html#_creating_systems_in_gcp[API Developer Guide^] for more details about using the "GcpEncryption" parameter.
